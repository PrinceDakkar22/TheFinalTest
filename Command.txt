To add the MyFile.txt to the repository, I used "git add MyFile.txt" and then "git commit -m" 
to commit it from the staging area. 



I created the subfolder Info by right clicking on the parent folder and selecting "new folder".
I then added two files named "InfoFile1" and "InfoFile2" to the subfolder. 

To add just the subfolder Info to the version control, I used "git add Info". 
This put both files that were located in the subfolder into the version control. 


To add _Info at the end of my username for the repo, I first used the "git config user.name" command.
This command let me know what my current username was so I could change it. I then used the 
"git config user.name "Benjamin Wentzell_Info"" command to change the username. 

To check the state of the repository I used the " git status " command. This command 
shows the files that are being tracked. 

When checking the status of the system, I noticed that Myfile.txt has been modified and that it will need to
be readded to the repository for the changes to apply. This is signfied by the red text and the fact that 
the file is showing up in the status.
